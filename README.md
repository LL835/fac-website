# fac-website
A website about me and why I want to pursue web development as a career. It provides some info about me and my motivations and showcases some of the projects that I have been working on. 

This project is part of the Founders and Coders application process. Requirements of the project were as follows:

* The website must have semantic HTML5 elements
* The website must use CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
* The website has DOM event listeners for user interaction (e.g. click, keydown)
* DOM updates are made in response to user interaction (e.g. showing/hiding an element, changing text or styles)
